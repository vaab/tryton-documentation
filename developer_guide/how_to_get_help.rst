How to get help
===============

IRC (Chat)
----------

Usually there are developers on the IRC chat, and they will try to help you if
you provide a good information about your problem.
You should supply as a minimum:

* Version of tryton you are running (found in the Help/About menu selection)
* What operating system and version of OS are you running
* What module is the problem
* Ideally a screenshot of the error you are encountering
* The sequence of steps to cause the problem

You can find more information on the `IRC (Chat)`_ section of user
documentation.

Mailing List
------------

* tryton-dev@googlegroups.com
* tryton-contrib@googlegroups.com
